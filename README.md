## Welcome to my main Projects folder! 

I am a second-year undergraduate at the National University of Singapore (NUS) with a deep passion for data science, machine learning, and building impactful projects. 
Featured in this repository are my projects revolving around data science - spanning a wide range of domains, including:

- Data Visualisation: Plotting Insightful and Aesthetic Plots with Libraries like Seaborn, Matplotlib and Plotly
- Web Scraping: Automating data collection from diverse sources to fuel data-driven insights using Libraries like Selenium and Beautiful Soup
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Combining Machine Learning Models and Various Visualisation techniques to garner as much information from various trivia as possible
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Developing models and tools for textual analysis and language understanding.
- Computer Vision (CV): Crafting solutions that bring vision-based machine learning applications to life.

and more!

I have a special fondness for tree-based machine learning algorithms and thrive on tackling complex problems. My journey also includes exploring supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning techniques, and applying them creatively across my projects.
