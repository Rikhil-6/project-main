    "This code was written simply as a fun project -> a thought experiment of analysing what\n",
    "would happen if thresholding and mapping was recursively applied on the pixel data of images.\n",
    "\n",
    "It works by essentially splitting the range 0 - 255 (0 - 256 exluding the upper limit) into\n",
    "bounded segments whereby they will be mapped to one number or another depending on which numbers they\n",
    "are smaller/greater than. This is really best illustrated through running the code and analysing both \n",
    "the direct code output as well as the images produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "While initially thought to be nothing special, through experimentation with the manner of splitting the \n",
    "segments (through the use of fractional components), as well as the number of recursions; I witness\n",
    "that this simple algorithm can result in images of varying natures to be created. These images can \n",
    "be 'artsy' / nostalgic / terrifying and more! Such a filter could also have possible steganographic \n",
    "implications and be used to hide/reveal information hidden in images or even just to enhance images to \n",
